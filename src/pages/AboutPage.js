        <i>The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark</i> is the William
        Shakespeare's longest play. It consists of over 30,000 words, some of
        which are utterly confusing.

        <b>Hamlet Helper</b> uses the Merriam-Webster's CollegiateÂ® Dictionary
        API to provide brief definitions of the words in Shakespeare's{" "}
        <i>Hamlet</i>. Every time a word from the text is clicked, a request is
        sent to the API, which sends back data as a response. This data is then
        processed and rendered to the user, who has the option to click a "View
        More" button to visit the corresponding dictionary entry on
        Merriam-Webster's website.

        Because reading Shakespeare should be a pleasant experience, not
        necessarily a laborious one.
