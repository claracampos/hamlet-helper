    <h3>SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.</h3>

    <p>
      <i>Enter Francisco and Barnardo, two sentinels.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      Who&rsquo;s there?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      FRANCISCO.
      <br />
      Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      Long live the King!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      FRANCISCO.
      <br />
      Barnardo?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      He.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      FRANCISCO.
      <br />
      You come most carefully upon your hour.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      FRANCISCO.
      <br />
      For this relief much thanks. &rsquo;Tis bitter cold,
      <br />
      And I am sick at heart.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      Have you had quiet guard?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      FRANCISCO.
      <br />
      Not a mouse stirring.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      Well, good night.
      <br />
      If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
      <br />
      The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Enter Horatio and Marcellus.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      FRANCISCO.
      <br />
      I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Friends to this ground.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      And liegemen to the Dane.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      FRANCISCO.
      <br />
      Give you good night.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      O, farewell, honest soldier, who hath reliev&rsquo;d you?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      FRANCISCO.
      <br />
      Barnardo has my place. Give you good-night.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Exit.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Holla, Barnardo!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      Say, what, is Horatio there?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      A piece of him.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      What, has this thing appear&rsquo;d again tonight?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      I have seen nothing.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Horatio says &rsquo;tis but our fantasy,
      <br />
      And will not let belief take hold of him
      <br />
      Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.
      <br />
      Therefore I have entreated him along
      <br />
      With us to watch the minutes of this night,
      <br />
      That if again this apparition come
      <br />
      He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Tush, tush, &rsquo;twill not appear.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      Sit down awhile,
      <br />
      And let us once again assail your ears,
      <br />
      That are so fortified against our story,
      <br />
      What we two nights have seen.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Well, sit we down,
      <br />
      And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      Last night of all,
      <br />
      When yond same star that&rsquo;s westward from the pole,
      <br />
      Had made his course t&rsquo;illume that part of heaven
      <br />
      Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
      <br />
      The bell then beating one&mdash;
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Enter Ghost.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      In the same figure, like the King that&rsquo;s dead.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO
      <br />
      It would be spoke to.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Question it, Horatio.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      What art thou that usurp&rsquo;st this time of night,
      <br />
      Together with that fair and warlike form
      <br />
      In which the majesty of buried Denmark
      <br />
      Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      It is offended.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      See, it stalks away.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Exit Ghost.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis gone, and will not answer.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale.
      <br />
      Is not this something more than fantasy?
      <br />
      What think you on&rsquo;t?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Before my God, I might not this believe
      <br />
      Without the sensible and true avouch
      <br />
      Of mine own eyes.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Is it not like the King?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      As thou art to thyself:
      <br />
      Such was the very armour he had on
      <br />
      When he th&rsquo;ambitious Norway combated;
      <br />
      So frown&rsquo;d he once, when in an angry parle
      <br />
      He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis strange.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
      <br />
      With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      In what particular thought to work I know not;
      <br />
      But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
      <br />
      This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
      <br />
      Why this same strict and most observant watch
      <br />
      So nightly toils the subject of the land,
      <br />
      And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
      <br />
      And foreign mart for implements of war;
      <br />
      Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
      <br />
      Does not divide the Sunday from the week.
      <br />
      What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
      <br />
      Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
      <br />
      Who is&rsquo;t that can inform me?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      That can I;
      <br />
      At least, the whisper goes so. Our last King,
      <br />
      Whose image even but now appear&rsquo;d to us,
      <br />
      Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
      <br />
      Thereto prick&rsquo;d on by a most emulate pride,
      <br />
      Dar&rsquo;d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,
      <br />
      For so this side of our known world esteem&rsquo;d him,
      <br />
      Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal&rsquo;d compact,
      <br />
      Well ratified by law and heraldry,
      <br />
      Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
      <br />
      Which he stood seiz&rsquo;d of, to the conqueror;
      <br />
      Against the which, a moiety competent
      <br />
      Was gaged by our King; which had return&rsquo;d
      <br />
      To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
      <br />
      Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov&rsquo;nant
      <br />
      And carriage of the article design&rsquo;d,
      <br />
      His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
      <br />
      Of unimproved mettle, hot and full,
      <br />
      Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
      <br />
      Shark&rsquo;d up a list of lawless resolutes,
      <br />
      For food and diet, to some enterprise
      <br />
      That hath a stomach in&rsquo;t; which is no other,
      <br />
      As it doth well appear unto our state,
      <br />
      But to recover of us by strong hand
      <br />
      And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
      <br />
      So by his father lost. And this, I take it,
      <br />
      Is the main motive of our preparations,
      <br />
      The source of this our watch, and the chief head
      <br />
      Of this post-haste and rummage in the land.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      I think it be no other but e&rsquo;en so:
      <br />
      Well may it sort that this portentous figure
      <br />
      Comes armed through our watch so like the King
      <br />
      That was and is the question of these wars.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      A mote it is to trouble the mind&rsquo;s eye.
      <br />
      In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
      <br />
      A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
      <br />
      The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
      <br />
      Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
      <br />
      As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
      <br />
      Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,
      <br />
      Upon whose influence Neptune&rsquo;s empire stands,
      <br />
      Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
      <br />
      And even the like precurse of fierce events,
      <br />
      As harbingers preceding still the fates
      <br />
      And prologue to the omen coming on,
      <br />
      Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
      <br />
      Unto our climatures and countrymen.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Re-enter Ghost.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      But, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!
      <br />
      I&rsquo;ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
      <br />
      If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
      <br />
      Speak to me.
      <br />
      If there be any good thing to be done,
      <br />
      That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,
      <br />
      Speak to me.
      <br />
      If thou art privy to thy country&rsquo;s fate,
      <br />
      Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
      <br />
      O speak!
      <br />
      Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
      <br />
      Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
      <br />
      For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
      <br />
      Speak of it. Stay, and speak!
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>The cock crows.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      Stop it, Marcellus!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Do, if it will not stand.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis here!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis here!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Exit Ghost.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis gone!
      <br />
      We do it wrong, being so majestical,
      <br />
      To offer it the show of violence,
      <br />
      For it is as the air, invulnerable,
      <br />
      And our vain blows malicious mockery.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BARNARDO.
      <br />
      It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      And then it started, like a guilty thing
      <br />
      Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
      <br />
      The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
      <br />
      Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
      <br />
      Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
      <br />
      Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
      <br />
      Th&rsquo;extravagant and erring spirit hies
      <br />
      To his confine. And of the truth herein
      <br />
      This present object made probation.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      It faded on the crowing of the cock.
      <br />
      Some say that ever &rsquo;gainst that season comes
      <br />
      Wherein our Saviour&rsquo;s birth is celebrated,
      <br />
      The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
      <br />
      And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
      <br />
      The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
      <br />
      No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;
      <br />
      So hallow&rsquo;d and so gracious is the time.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
      <br />
      But look, the morn in russet mantle clad,
      <br />
      Walks o&rsquo;er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
      <br />
      Break we our watch up, and by my advice,
      <br />
      Let us impart what we have seen tonight
      <br />
      Unto young Hamlet; for upon my life,
      <br />
      This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
      <br />
      Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
      <br />
      As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Let&rsquo;s do&rsquo;t, I pray, and I this morning know
      <br />
      Where we shall find him most conveniently.
      <br />
