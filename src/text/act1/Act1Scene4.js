      <i>Enter Hamlet, Horatio and Marcellus.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      It is a nipping and an eager air.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      What hour now?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      I think it lacks of twelve.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      No, it is struck.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
      <br />
      Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within.]</i>
    </p>

    <p>What does this mean, my lord?</p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,
      <br />
      Keeps wassail, and the swaggering upspring reels;
      <br />
      And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
      <br />
      The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
      <br />
      The triumph of his pledge.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Is it a custom?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Ay marry is&rsquo;t;
      <br />
      And to my mind, though I am native here,
      <br />
      And to the manner born, it is a custom
      <br />
      More honour&rsquo;d in the breach than the observance.
      <br />
      This heavy-headed revel east and west
      <br />
      Makes us traduc&rsquo;d and tax&rsquo;d of other nations:
      <br />
      They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
      <br />
      Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
      <br />
      From our achievements, though perform&rsquo;d at height,
      <br />
      The pith and marrow of our attribute.
      <br />
      So oft it chances in particular men
      <br />
      That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
      <br />
      As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty,
      <br />
      Since nature cannot choose his origin,
      <br />
      By their o&rsquo;ergrowth of some complexion,
      <br />
      Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;
      <br />
      Or by some habit, that too much o&rsquo;erleavens
      <br />
      The form of plausive manners;&mdash;that these men,
      <br />
      Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
      <br />
      Being Nature&rsquo;s livery or Fortune&rsquo;s star,&mdash;
      <br />
      His virtues else,&mdash;be they as pure as grace,
      <br />
      As infinite as man may undergo,
      <br />
      Shall in the general censure take corruption
      <br />
      From that particular fault. The dram of evil
      <br />
      Doth all the noble substance often doubt
      <br />
      To his own scandal.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Look, my lord, it comes!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Enter Ghost.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
      <br />
      Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn&rsquo;d,
      <br />
      Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
      <br />
      Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
      <br />
      Thou com&rsquo;st in such a questionable shape
      <br />
      That I will speak to thee. I&rsquo;ll call thee Hamlet,
      <br />
      King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me!
      <br />
      Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
      <br />
      Why thy canoniz&rsquo;d bones, hearsed in death,
      <br />
      Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
      <br />
      Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn&rsquo;d,
      <br />
      Hath op&rsquo;d his ponderous and marble jaws
      <br />
      To cast thee up again! What may this mean,
      <br />
      That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
      <br />
      Revisit&rsquo;st thus the glimpses of the moon,
      <br />
      Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
      <br />
      So horridly to shake our disposition
      <br />
      With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
      <br />
      Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Ghost beckons Hamlet.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      It beckons you to go away with it,
      <br />
      As if it some impartment did desire
      <br />
      To you alone.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Look with what courteous action
      <br />
      It waves you to a more removed ground.
      <br />
      But do not go with it.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      No, by no means.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      It will not speak; then will I follow it.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Do not, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Why, what should be the fear?
      <br />
      I do not set my life at a pin&rsquo;s fee;
      <br />
      And for my soul, what can it do to that,
      <br />
      Being a thing immortal as itself?
      <br />
      It waves me forth again. I&rsquo;ll follow it.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
      <br />
      Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
      <br />
      That beetles o&rsquo;er his base into the sea,
      <br />
      And there assume some other horrible form
      <br />
      Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,
      <br />
      And draw you into madness? Think of it.
      <br />
      The very place puts toys of desperation,
      <br />
      Without more motive, into every brain
      <br />
      That looks so many fadoms to the sea
      <br />
      And hears it roar beneath.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      It waves me still.
      <br />
      Go on, I&rsquo;ll follow thee.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      You shall not go, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Hold off your hands.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Be rul&rsquo;d; you shall not go.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      My fate cries out,
      <br />
      And makes each petty artery in this body
      <br />
      As hardy as the Nemean lion&rsquo;s nerve.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      [<i>Ghost beckons.</i>]
    </p>

    <p>Still am I call&rsquo;d. Unhand me, gentlemen.</p>

    <p>
      [<i>Breaking free from them.</i>]
    </p>

    <p>
      By heaven, I&rsquo;ll make a ghost of him that lets me.
      <br />
      I say, away!&mdash;Go on, I&rsquo;ll follow thee.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      He waxes desperate with imagination.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Let&rsquo;s follow; &rsquo;tis not fit thus to obey him.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Have after. To what issue will this come?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Heaven will direct it.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Nay, let&rsquo;s follow him.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Exeunt.</i>
