    <h3>SCENE II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.</h3>

    <p>
      <i>
        Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius,
        Laertes, Voltemand, Cornelius, Lords and Attendant.
      </i>
    </p>

    <p>
      KING.
      <br />
      Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother&rsquo;s death
      <br />
      The memory be green, and that it us befitted
      <br />
      To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
      <br />
      To be contracted in one brow of woe;
      <br />
      Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
      <br />
      That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
      <br />
      Together with remembrance of ourselves.
      <br />
      Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
      <br />
      Th&rsquo;imperial jointress to this warlike state,
      <br />
      Have we, as &rsquo;twere with a defeated joy,
      <br />
      With one auspicious and one dropping eye,
      <br />
      With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
      <br />
      In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
      <br />
      Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr&rsquo;d
      <br />
      Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
      <br />
      With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
      <br />
      Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras,
      <br />
      Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
      <br />
      Or thinking by our late dear brother&rsquo;s death
      <br />
      Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
      <br />
      Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
      <br />
      He hath not fail&rsquo;d to pester us with message,
      <br />
      Importing the surrender of those lands
      <br />
      Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
      <br />
      To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
      <br />
      Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
      <br />
      Thus much the business is: we have here writ
      <br />
      To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
      <br />
      Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
      <br />
      Of this his nephew&rsquo;s purpose, to suppress
      <br />
      His further gait herein; in that the levies,
      <br />
      The lists, and full proportions are all made
      <br />
      Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
      <br />
      You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
      <br />
      For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
      <br />
      Giving to you no further personal power
      <br />
      To business with the King, more than the scope
      <br />
      Of these dilated articles allow.
      <br />
      Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.
      <br />
      In that, and all things, will we show our duty.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      KING.
      <br />
      We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      And now, Laertes, what&rsquo;s the news with you?
      <br />
      You told us of some suit. What is&rsquo;t, Laertes?
      <br />
      You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
      <br />
      And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
      <br />
      That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
      <br />
      The head is not more native to the heart,
      <br />
      The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
      <br />
      Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
      <br />
      What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      LAERTES.
      <br />
      Dread my lord,
      <br />
      Your leave and favour to return to France,
      <br />
      From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
      <br />
      To show my duty in your coronation;
      <br />
      Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
      <br />
      My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
      <br />
      And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      KING.
      <br />
      Have you your father&rsquo;s leave? What says Polonius?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      POLONIUS.
      <br />
      He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
      <br />
      By laboursome petition; and at last
      <br />
      Upon his will I seal&rsquo;d my hard consent.
      <br />
      I do beseech you give him leave to go.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      KING.
      <br />
      Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
      <br />
      And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
      <br />
      But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son&mdash;
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      <i>[Aside.]</i> A little more than kin, and less than kind.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      KING.
      <br />
      How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Not so, my lord, I am too much i&rsquo; the sun.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      QUEEN.
      <br />
      Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
      <br />
      And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
      <br />
      Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
      <br />
      Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
      <br />
      Thou know&rsquo;st &rsquo;tis common, all that lives must die,
      <br />
      Passing through nature to eternity.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Ay, madam, it is common.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      QUEEN.
      <br />
      If it be,
      <br />
      Why seems it so particular with thee?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
      <br />
      Nor customary suits of solemn black,
      <br />
      Nor windy suspiration of forc&rsquo;d breath,
      <br />
      No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
      <br />
      Nor the dejected haviour of the visage,
      <br />
      Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,
      <br />
      That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
      <br />
      For they are actions that a man might play;
      <br />
      But I have that within which passeth show;
      <br />
      These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      KING.
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
      <br />
      To give these mourning duties to your father;
      <br />
      But you must know, your father lost a father,
      <br />
      That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
      <br />
      In filial obligation, for some term
      <br />
      To do obsequious sorrow. But to persevere
      <br />
      In obstinate condolement is a course
      <br />
      Of impious stubbornness. &rsquo;Tis unmanly grief,
      <br />
      It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
      <br />
      A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
      <br />
      An understanding simple and unschool&rsquo;d;
      <br />
      For what we know must be, and is as common
      <br />
      As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
      <br />
      Why should we in our peevish opposition
      <br />
      Take it to heart? Fie, &rsquo;tis a fault to heaven,
      <br />
      A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
      <br />
      To reason most absurd, whose common theme
      <br />
      Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
      <br />
      From the first corse till he that died today,
      <br />
      &lsquo;This must be so.&rsquo; We pray you throw to earth
      <br />
      This unprevailing woe, and think of us
      <br />
      As of a father; for let the world take note
      <br />
      You are the most immediate to our throne,
      <br />
      And with no less nobility of love
      <br />
      Than that which dearest father bears his son
      <br />
      Do I impart toward you. For your intent
      <br />
      In going back to school in Wittenberg,
      <br />
      It is most retrograde to our desire:
      <br />
      And we beseech you bend you to remain
      <br />
      Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
      <br />
      Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      QUEEN.
      <br />
      Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
      <br />
      I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      KING.
      <br />
      Why, &rsquo;tis a loving and a fair reply.
      <br />
      Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
      <br />
      This gentle and unforc&rsquo;d accord of Hamlet
      <br />
      Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
      <br />
      No jocund health that Denmark drinks today
      <br />
      But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
      <br />
      And the King&rsquo;s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
      <br />
      Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Exeunt all but Hamlet.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
      <br />
      Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
      <br />
      Or that the Everlasting had not fix&rsquo;d
      <br />
      His canon &rsquo;gainst self-slaughter. O God! O God!
      <br />
      How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
      <br />
      Seem to me all the uses of this world!
      <br />
      Fie on&rsquo;t! Oh fie! &rsquo;tis an unweeded garden
      <br />
      That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
      <br />
      Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
      <br />
      But two months dead&mdash;nay, not so much, not two:
      <br />
      So excellent a king; that was to this
      <br />
      Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,
      <br />
      That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
      <br />
      Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
      <br />
      Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
      <br />
      As if increase of appetite had grown
      <br />
      By what it fed on; and yet, within a month&mdash;
      <br />
      Let me not think on&rsquo;t&mdash;Frailty, thy name is woman!
      <br />
      A little month, or ere those shoes were old
      <br />
      With which she followed my poor father&rsquo;s body
      <br />
      Like Niobe, all tears.&mdash;Why she, even she&mdash;
      <br />
      O God! A beast that wants discourse of reason
      <br />
      Would have mourn&rsquo;d longer,&mdash;married with mine uncle,
      <br />
      My father&rsquo;s brother; but no more like my father
      <br />
      Than I to Hercules. Within a month?
      <br />
      Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
      <br />
      Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
      <br />
      She married. O most wicked speed, to post
      <br />
      With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
      <br />
      It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
      <br />
      But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Enter Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Hail to your lordship!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      I am glad to see you well:
      <br />
      Horatio, or I do forget myself.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      The same, my lord,
      <br />
      And your poor servant ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Sir, my good friend;
      <br />
      I&rsquo;ll change that name with you:
      <br />
      And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?&mdash;
      <br />
      Marcellus?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      My good lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      I am very glad to see you.&mdash;Good even, sir.&mdash;
      <br />
      But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      A truant disposition, good my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      I would not hear your enemy say so;
      <br />
      Nor shall you do my ear that violence,
      <br />
      To make it truster of your own report
      <br />
      Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
      <br />
      But what is your affair in Elsinore?
      <br />
      We&rsquo;ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      My lord, I came to see your father&rsquo;s funeral.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.
      <br />
      I think it was to see my mother&rsquo;s wedding.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Indeed, my lord, it follow&rsquo;d hard upon.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak&rsquo;d meats
      <br />
      Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
      <br />
      Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
      <br />
      Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio.
      <br />
      My father,&mdash;methinks I see my father.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Where, my lord?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      In my mind&rsquo;s eye, Horatio.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      He was a man, take him for all in all,
      <br />
      I shall not look upon his like again.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Saw? Who?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      My lord, the King your father.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      The King my father!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Season your admiration for a while
      <br />
      With an attent ear, till I may deliver
      <br />
      Upon the witness of these gentlemen
      <br />
      This marvel to you.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      For God&rsquo;s love let me hear.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Two nights together had these gentlemen,
      <br />
      Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch
      <br />
      In the dead waste and middle of the night,
      <br />
      Been thus encounter&rsquo;d. A figure like your father,
      <br />
      Armed at point exactly, cap-à-pie,
      <br />
      Appears before them, and with solemn march
      <br />
      Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk&rsquo;d
      <br />
      By their oppress&rsquo;d and fear-surprised eyes,
      <br />
      Within his truncheon&rsquo;s length; whilst they, distill&rsquo;d
      <br />
      Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
      <br />
      Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me
      <br />
      In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
      <br />
      And I with them the third night kept the watch,
      <br />
      Where, as they had deliver&rsquo;d, both in time,
      <br />
      Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
      <br />
      The apparition comes. I knew your father;
      <br />
      These hands are not more like.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      But where was this?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      My lord, upon the platform where we watch.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Did you not speak to it?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      My lord, I did;
      <br />
      But answer made it none: yet once methought
      <br />
      It lifted up it head, and did address
      <br />
      Itself to motion, like as it would speak.
      <br />
      But even then the morning cock crew loud,
      <br />
      And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
      <br />
      And vanish&rsquo;d from our sight.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis very strange.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      As I do live, my honour&rsquo;d lord, &rsquo;tis true;
      <br />
      And we did think it writ down in our duty
      <br />
      To let you know of it.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
      <br />
      Hold you the watch tonight?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Mar. and BARNARDO.
      <br />
      We do, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Arm&rsquo;d, say you?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Both.
      <br />
      Arm&rsquo;d, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      From top to toe?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      BOTH.
      <br />
      My lord, from head to foot.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Then saw you not his face?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      What, look&rsquo;d he frowningly?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Pale, or red?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Nay, very pale.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      And fix&rsquo;d his eyes upon you?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Most constantly.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      I would I had been there.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      It would have much amaz&rsquo;d you.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Very like, very like. Stay&rsquo;d it long?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.
      <br />
      Longer, longer.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Not when I saw&rsquo;t.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      His beard was grizzled, no?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      It was, as I have seen it in his life,
      <br />
      A sable silver&rsquo;d.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      I will watch tonight;
      <br />
      Perchance &rsquo;twill walk again.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      I warrant you it will.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      If it assume my noble father&rsquo;s person,
      <br />
      I&rsquo;ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
      <br />
      And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
      <br />
      If you have hitherto conceal&rsquo;d this sight,
      <br />
      Let it be tenable in your silence still;
      <br />
      And whatsoever else shall hap tonight,
      <br />
      Give it an understanding, but no tongue.
      <br />
      I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well.
      <br />
      Upon the platform &rsquo;twixt eleven and twelve,
      <br />
      I&rsquo;ll visit you.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      ALL.
      <br />
      Our duty to your honour.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      My father&rsquo;s spirit in arms! All is not well;
      <br />
      I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
      <br />
      Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
      <br />
      Though all the earth o&rsquo;erwhelm them, to men&rsquo;s eyes.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Exit.</i>
