    <h3>SCENE III. A room in Polonius&rsquo;s house.</h3>

    <p>
      <i>Enter Laertes and Ophelia.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      LAERTES.
      <br />
      My necessaries are embark&rsquo;d. Farewell.
      <br />
      And, sister, as the winds give benefit
      <br />
      And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
      <br />
      But let me hear from you.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      OPHELIA.
      <br />
      Do you doubt that?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      LAERTES.
      <br />
      For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
      <br />
      Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood;
      <br />
      A violet in the youth of primy nature,
      <br />
      Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;
      <br />
      The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
      <br />
      No more.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      OPHELIA.
      <br />
      No more but so?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      LAERTES.
      <br />
      Think it no more.
      <br />
      For nature crescent does not grow alone
      <br />
      In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
      <br />
      The inward service of the mind and soul
      <br />
      Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
      <br />
      And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
      <br />
      The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
      <br />
      His greatness weigh&rsquo;d, his will is not his own;
      <br />
      For he himself is subject to his birth:
      <br />
      He may not, as unvalu&rsquo;d persons do,
      <br />
      Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
      <br />
      The sanctity and health of this whole state;
      <br />
      And therefore must his choice be circumscrib&rsquo;d
      <br />
      Unto the voice and yielding of that body
      <br />
      Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
      <br />
      It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
      <br />
      As he in his particular act and place
      <br />
      May give his saying deed; which is no further
      <br />
      Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
      <br />
      Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
      <br />
      If with too credent ear you list his songs,
      <br />
      Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
      <br />
      To his unmaster&rsquo;d importunity.
      <br />
      Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;
      <br />
      And keep you in the rear of your affection,
      <br />
      Out of the shot and danger of desire.
      <br />
      The chariest maid is prodigal enough
      <br />
      If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
      <br />
      Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:
      <br />
      The canker galls the infants of the spring
      <br />
      Too oft before their buttons be disclos&rsquo;d,
      <br />
      And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
      <br />
      Contagious blastments are most imminent.
      <br />
      Be wary then, best safety lies in fear.
      <br />
      Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      OPHELIA.
      <br />
      I shall th&rsquo;effect of this good lesson keep
      <br />
      As watchman to my heart. But good my brother,
      <br />
      Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
      <br />
      Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
      <br />
      Whilst like a puff&rsquo;d and reckless libertine
      <br />
      Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
      <br />
      And recks not his own rede.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      LAERTES.
      <br />
      O, fear me not.
      <br />
      I stay too long. But here my father comes.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Enter Polonius.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      A double blessing is a double grace;
      <br />
      Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      POLONIUS.
      <br />
      Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame.
      <br />
      The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
      <br />
      And you are stay&rsquo;d for. There, my blessing with you.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      [<i>Laying his hand on Laertes&rsquo;s head.</i>]
    </p>

    <p>
      And these few precepts in thy memory
      <br />
      Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
      <br />
      Nor any unproportion&rsquo;d thought his act.
      <br />
      Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
      <br />
      Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
      <br />
      Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
      <br />
      But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
      <br />
      Of each new-hatch&rsquo;d, unfledg&rsquo;d comrade. Beware
      <br />
      Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
      <br />
      Bear&rsquo;t that th&rsquo;opposed may beware of thee.
      <br />
      Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:
      <br />
      Take each man&rsquo;s censure, but reserve thy judgment.
      <br />
      Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
      <br />
      But not express&rsquo;d in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
      <br />
      For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
      <br />
      And they in France of the best rank and station
      <br />
      Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
      <br />
      Neither a borrower nor a lender be:
      <br />
      For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
      <br />
      And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
      <br />
      This above all: to thine own self be true;
      <br />
      And it must follow, as the night the day,
      <br />
      Thou canst not then be false to any man.
      <br />
      Farewell: my blessing season this in thee.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      LAERTES.
      <br />
      Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      POLONIUS.
      <br />
      The time invites you; go, your servants tend.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      LAERTES.
      <br />
      Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
      <br />
      What I have said to you.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      OPHELIA.
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis in my memory lock&rsquo;d,
      <br />
      And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      LAERTES.
      <br />
      Farewell.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Exit.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      POLONIUS.
      <br />
      What is&rsquo;t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      OPHELIA.
      <br />
      So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      POLONIUS.
      <br />
      Marry, well bethought:
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis told me he hath very oft of late
      <br />
      Given private time to you; and you yourself
      <br />
      Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
      <br />
      If it be so,&mdash;as so &rsquo;tis put on me,
      <br />
      And that in way of caution,&mdash;I must tell you
      <br />
      You do not understand yourself so clearly
      <br />
      As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
      <br />
      What is between you? Give me up the truth.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      OPHELIA.
      <br />
      He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
      <br />
      Of his affection to me.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      POLONIUS.
      <br />
      Affection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
      <br />
      Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
      <br />
      Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      OPHELIA.
      <br />
      I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      POLONIUS.
      <br />
      Marry, I&rsquo;ll teach you; think yourself a baby;
      <br />
      That you have ta&rsquo;en these tenders for true pay,
      <br />
      Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
      <br />
      Or,&mdash;not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
      <br />
      Roaming it thus,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll tender me a fool.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      OPHELIA.
      <br />
      My lord, he hath importun&rsquo;d me with love
      <br />
      In honourable fashion.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      POLONIUS.
      <br />
      Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      OPHELIA.
      <br />
      And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
      <br />
      With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      POLONIUS.
      <br />
      Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
      <br />
      When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
      <br />
      Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
      <br />
      Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
      <br />
      Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
      <br />
      You must not take for fire. From this time
      <br />
      Be something scanter of your maiden presence;
      <br />
      Set your entreatments at a higher rate
      <br />
      Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
      <br />
      Believe so much in him that he is young;
      <br />
      And with a larger tether may he walk
      <br />
      Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
      <br />
      Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
      <br />
      Not of that dye which their investments show,
      <br />
      But mere implorators of unholy suits,
      <br />
      Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
      <br />
      The better to beguile. This is for all.
      <br />
      I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
      <br />
      Have you so slander any moment leisure
      <br />
      As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
      <br />
      Look to&rsquo;t, I charge you; come your ways.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      OPHELIA.
      <br />
      I shall obey, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
