    <p>
      <i>Enter Ghost and Hamlet.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I&rsquo;ll go no further.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />
      Mark me.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      I will.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />
      My hour is almost come,
      <br />
      When I to sulph&rsquo;rous and tormenting flames
      <br />
      Must render up myself.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Alas, poor ghost!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />
      Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
      <br />
      To what I shall unfold.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Speak, I am bound to hear.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />
      So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      What?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />
      I am thy father&rsquo;s spirit,
      <br />
      Doom&rsquo;d for a certain term to walk the night,
      <br />
      And for the day confin&rsquo;d to fast in fires,
      <br />
      Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
      <br />
      Are burnt and purg&rsquo;d away. But that I am forbid
      <br />
      To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
      <br />
      I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
      <br />
      Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood,
      <br />
      Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,
      <br />
      Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
      <br />
      And each particular hair to stand on end
      <br />
      Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.
      <br />
      But this eternal blazon must not be
      <br />
      To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
      <br />
      If thou didst ever thy dear father love&mdash;
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      O God!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />
      Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Murder!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />
      Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
      <br />
      But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Haste me to know&rsquo;t, that I, with wings as swift
      <br />
      As meditation or the thoughts of love
      <br />
      May sweep to my revenge.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />
      I find thee apt;
      <br />
      And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
      <br />
      That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
      <br />
      Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
      <br />
      &rsquo;Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
      <br />
      A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
      <br />
      Is by a forged process of my death
      <br />
      Rankly abus&rsquo;d; but know, thou noble youth,
      <br />
      The serpent that did sting thy father&rsquo;s life
      <br />
      Now wears his crown.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      O my prophetic soul!
      <br />
      Mine uncle!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />
      Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
      <br />
      With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,&mdash;
      <br />
      O wicked wit, and gifts, that have the power
      <br />
      So to seduce!&mdash;won to his shameful lust
      <br />
      The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
      <br />
      O Hamlet, what a falling off was there,
      <br />
      From me, whose love was of that dignity
      <br />
      That it went hand in hand even with the vow
      <br />
      I made to her in marriage; and to decline
      <br />
      Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
      <br />
      To those of mine. But virtue, as it never will be mov&rsquo;d,
      <br />
      Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;
      <br />
      So lust, though to a radiant angel link&rsquo;d,
      <br />
      Will sate itself in a celestial bed
      <br />
      And prey on garbage.
      <br />
      But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
      <br />
      Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
      <br />
      My custom always of the afternoon,
      <br />
      Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
      <br />
      With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
      <br />
      And in the porches of my ears did pour
      <br />
      The leperous distilment, whose effect
      <br />
      Holds such an enmity with blood of man
      <br />
      That swift as quicksilver it courses through
      <br />
      The natural gates and alleys of the body;
      <br />
      And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
      <br />
      And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
      <br />
      The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
      <br />
      And a most instant tetter bark&rsquo;d about,
      <br />
      Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
      <br />
      All my smooth body.
      <br />
      Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother&rsquo;s hand,
      <br />
      Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatch&rsquo;d:
      <br />
      Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
      <br />
      Unhous&rsquo;led, disappointed, unanel&rsquo;d;
      <br />
      No reckoning made, but sent to my account
      <br />
      With all my imperfections on my head.
      <br />
      O horrible! O horrible! most horrible!
      <br />
      If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
      <br />
      Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
      <br />
      A couch for luxury and damned incest.
      <br />
      But howsoever thou pursu&rsquo;st this act,
      <br />
      Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
      <br />
      Against thy mother aught; leave her to heaven,
      <br />
      And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
      <br />
      To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
      <br />
      The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
      <br />
      And &rsquo;gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
      <br />
      Adieu, adieu, adieu. Hamlet, remember me.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Exit.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
      <br />
      And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart;
      <br />
      And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
      <br />
      But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
      <br />
      Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
      <br />
      In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
      <br />
      Yea, from the table of my memory
      <br />
      I&rsquo;ll wipe away all trivial fond records,
      <br />
      All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
      <br />
      That youth and observation copied there;
      <br />
      And thy commandment all alone shall live
      <br />
      Within the book and volume of my brain,
      <br />
      Unmix&rsquo;d with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
      <br />
      O most pernicious woman!
      <br />
      O villain, villain, smiling damned villain!
      <br />
      My tables. Meet it is I set it down,
      <br />
      That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!
      <br />
      At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      [<i>Writing.</i>]
    </p>

    <p>
      So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
      <br />
      It is &lsquo;Adieu, adieu, remember me.&rsquo;
      <br />
      I have sworn&rsquo;t.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO and MARCELLUS.
      <br />[<i>Within.</i>] My lord, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />[<i>Within.</i>] Lord Hamlet.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />[<i>Within.</i>] Heaven secure him.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      So be it!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />[<i>Within.</i>] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Enter Horatio and Marcellus.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      How is&rsquo;t, my noble lord?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      What news, my lord?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      O, wonderful!
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Good my lord, tell it.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      No, you&rsquo;ll reveal it.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Not I, my lord, by heaven.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Nor I, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      How say you then, would heart of man once think it?&mdash;
      <br />
      But you&rsquo;ll be secret?
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO and MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Ay, by heaven, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      There&rsquo;s ne&rsquo;er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
      <br />
      But he&rsquo;s an arrant knave.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
      <br />
      To tell us this.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Why, right; you are i&rsquo; the right;
      <br />
      And so, without more circumstance at all,
      <br />
      I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
      <br />
      You, as your business and desires shall point you,&mdash;
      <br />
      For every man hath business and desire,
      <br />
      Such as it is;&mdash;and for my own poor part,
      <br />
      Look you, I&rsquo;ll go pray.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      I&rsquo;m sorry they offend you, heartily;
      <br />
      Yes faith, heartily.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      There&rsquo;s no offence, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
      <br />
      And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
      <br />
      It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
      <br />
      For your desire to know what is between us,
      <br />
      O&rsquo;ermaster&rsquo;t as you may. And now, good friends,
      <br />
      As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
      <br />
      Give me one poor request.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      What is&rsquo;t, my lord? We will.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Never make known what you have seen tonight.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO and MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      My lord, we will not.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Nay, but swear&rsquo;t.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      In faith, my lord, not I.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      Nor I, my lord, in faith.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Upon my sword.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      MARCELLUS.
      <br />
      We have sworn, my lord, already.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />[<i>Cries under the stage.</i>] Swear.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Ha, ha boy, say&rsquo;st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
      <br />
      Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.
      <br />
      Consent to swear.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      Propose the oath, my lord.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Never to speak of this that you have seen.
      <br />
      Swear by my sword.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />[<i>Beneath.</i>] Swear.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      <i>Hic et ubique?</i> Then we&rsquo;ll shift our ground.
      <br />
      Come hither, gentlemen,
      <br />
      And lay your hands again upon my sword.
      <br />
      Never to speak of this that you have heard.
      <br />
      Swear by my sword.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />[<i>Beneath.</i>] Swear.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Well said, old mole! Canst work i&rsquo; th&rsquo;earth so fast?
      <br />
      A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HORATIO.
      <br />
      O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
      <br />
      There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
      <br />
      Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come,
      <br />
      Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
      <br />
      How strange or odd soe&rsquo;er I bear myself,&mdash;
      <br />
      As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
      <br />
      To put an antic disposition on&mdash;
      <br />
      That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
      <br />
      With arms encumber&rsquo;d thus, or this head-shake,
      <br />
      Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
      <br />
      As &lsquo;Well, we know&rsquo;, or &lsquo;We could and if we would&rsquo;,
      <br />
      Or &lsquo;If we list to speak&rsquo;; or &lsquo;There be and if they
      might&rsquo;,
      <br />
      Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
      <br />
      That you know aught of me:&mdash;this not to do.
      <br />
      So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
      <br />
      Swear.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      GHOST.
      <br />[<i>Beneath.</i>] Swear.
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      HAMLET.
      <br />
      Rest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen,
      <br />
      With all my love I do commend me to you;
      <br />
      And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
      <br />
      May do t&rsquo;express his love and friending to you,
      <br />
      God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,
      <br />
      And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
      <br />
      The time is out of joint. O cursed spite,
      <br />
      That ever I was born to set it right.
      <br />
      Nay, come, let&rsquo;s go together.
