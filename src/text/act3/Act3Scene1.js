    <h3>SCENE I. A room in the Castle.</h3>
    <p className="stage-direction">
      Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

    <p className="character-name">KING.</p>
    <p className="word-split">And can you by no drift of circumstance</p>
    <p className="word-split">Get from him why he puts on this confusion,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Grating so harshly all his days of quiet</p>
    <p className="word-split">With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</p>
    <p className="character-name">ROSENCRANTZ.</p>
    <p className="word-split">He does confess he feels himself distracted,</p>
    <p className="word-split">But from what cause he will by no means speak.</p>
    <p className="character-name">GUILDENSTERN.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,</p>
    <p className="word-split">But with a crafty madness keeps aloof</p>
    <p className="word-split">When we would bring him on to some confession</p>
    <p className="word-split">Of his true state.</p>
    <p className="character-name">QUEEN.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Did he receive you well?</p>
    <p className="character-name">ROSENCRANTZ.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Most like a gentleman.</p>
    <p className="character-name">GUILDENSTERN.</p>
    <p className="word-split">But with much forcing of his disposition.</p>
    <p className="character-name">ROSENCRANTZ.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Niggard of question, but of our demands,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Most free in his reply.</p>
    <p className="character-name">QUEEN.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Did you assay him to any pastime?</p>
    <p className="character-name">ROSENCRANTZ.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Madam, it so fell out that certain players</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      We o'er-raught on the way. Of these we told him,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">And there did seem in him a kind of joy</p>
    <p className="word-split">To hear of it. They are about the court,</p>
    <p className="word-split">And, as I think, they have already order</p>
    <p className="word-split">This night to play before him.</p>
    <p className="character-name">POLONIUS.</p>
    <p className="word-split">'Tis most true;</p>
    <p className="word-split">And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties</p>
    <p className="word-split">To hear and see the matter.</p>
    <p className="character-name">KING.</p>
    <p className="word-split">With all my heart; and it doth much content me</p>
    <p className="word-split">To hear him so inclin'd.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,</p>
    <p className="word-split">And drive his purpose on to these delights.</p>

    <p className="character-name">KING.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,</p>
    <p className="word-split">For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,</p>
    <p className="word-split">That he, as 'twere by accident, may here</p>
    <p className="word-split">Affront Ophelia.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Her father and myself, lawful espials,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,</p>
    <p className="word-split">We may of their encounter frankly judge,</p>
    <p className="word-split">And gather by him, as he is behav'd,</p>
    <p className="word-split">If't be th'affliction of his love or no</p>
    <p className="word-split">That thus he suffers for.</p>
    <p className="character-name">QUEEN.</p>
    <p className="word-split">I shall obey you.</p>
    <p className="word-split">And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish</p>
    <p className="word-split">That your good beauties be the happy cause</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues

      Ophelia, walk you here. -- Gracious, so please you,

    <p className="word-split">
      We will bestow ourselves. -- [To Ophelia.] Read on this book,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">That show of such an exercise may colour</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Your loneliness. -- We are oft to blame in this,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">
      'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage

    <p className="word-split">
      How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">
      The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it</p>
    <p className="word-split">Than is my deed to my most painted word.</p>
    <p className="word-split">O heavy burden!</p>
    <p className="character-name">POLONIUS.</p>
    <p className="word-split">I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.</p>
    <p className="stage-direction">[Exeunt King and Polonius.]</p>
    <p className="stage-direction"> Enter Hamlet.</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">To be, or not to be, that is the question:</p>
    <p className="word-split">Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
    <p className="word-split">The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</p>
    <p className="word-split">And by opposing end them? To die -- to sleep,</p>
    <p className="word-split">No more; and by a sleep to say we end</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation</p>
    <p className="word-split">Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      To sleep, perchance to dream -- ay, there's the rub,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">
      For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Must give us pause. There's the respect</p>
    <p className="word-split">That makes calamity of so long life.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">
      The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,</p>
    <p className="word-split">The insolence of office, and the spurns</p>
    <p className="word-split">That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</p>
    <p className="word-split">When he himself might his quietus make</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</p>
    <p className="word-split">But that the dread of something after death,</p>
    <p className="word-split">The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn</p>
    <p className="word-split">No traveller returns, puzzles the will,</p>
    <p className="word-split">And makes us rather bear those ills we have</p>
    <p className="word-split">Than fly to others that we know not of?</p>
    <p className="word-split">Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</p>
    <p className="word-split">And thus the native hue of resolution</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">And enterprises of great pith and moment,</p>
    <p className="word-split">With this regard their currents turn awry</p>
    <p className="word-split">And lose the name of action. Soft you now,</p>
    <p className="word-split">The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons</p>
    <p className="word-split">Be all my sins remember'd.</p>
    <p className="character-name">OPHELIA.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Good my lord,</p>
    <p className="word-split">How does your honour for this many a day?</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">I humbly thank you; well, well, well.</p>
    <p className="character-name">OPHELIA.</p>
    <p className="word-split">My lord, I have remembrances of yours</p>
    <p className="word-split">That I have longed long to re-deliver.</p>
    <p className="word-split">I pray you, now receive them.</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">No, not I.</p>
    <p className="word-split">I never gave you aught.</p>
    <p className="character-name">OPHELIA.</p>
    <p className="word-split">My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">
      As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">Take these again; for to the noble mind</p>
    <p className="word-split">Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.</p>
    <p className="word-split">There, my lord.</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Ha, ha! Are you honest?</p>
    <p className="character-name">OPHELIA.</p>
    <p className="word-split">My lord?</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Are you fair?</p>
    <p className="character-name">OPHELIA.</p>
    <p className="word-split">What means your lordship?</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to
      your beauty.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">OPHELIA.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what
      it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his
      likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I
      did love you once.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">OPHELIA.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old
      stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">OPHELIA.</p>
    <p className="word-split">I was the more deceived.</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am
      myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that
      it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful,
      ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them
      in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should
      such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant
      knaves all, believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
      father?
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">OPHELIA.</p>
    <p className="word-split">At home, my lord.</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's
      own house. Farewell.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">OPHELIA.</p>
    <p className="word-split">O help him, you sweet heavens!</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou as
      chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to
      a nunnery, go: farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for
      wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery,
      go; and quickly too. Farewell.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">OPHELIA.</p>
    <p className="word-split">O heavenly powers, restore him!</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you one
      face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and you lisp,
      and nickname God's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go
      to, I'll no more on't, it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more
      marriages. Those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the
      rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.
