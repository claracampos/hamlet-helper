      Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the
      tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the
      town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand,
      thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may
      say, whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that
      may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
      periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the
      ears of the groundlings, who, for the most part, are capable of nothing
      but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipped
      for o'erdoing Termagant. It out-Herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.

      Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit
      the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special
      observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything so
      overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and
      now, was and is, to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature; to show virtue
      her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the
      time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though
      it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
      censure of the which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre
      of others. O, there be players that I have seen play -- and heard others
      praise, and that highly -- not to speak it profanely, that, neither having
      the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have
      so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen
      had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so
      abominably.

    <p className="word-split">
      O reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more
      than is set down for them. For there be of them that will themselves
      laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though
      in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be
      considered. That's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the
      fool that uses it. Go make you ready.
