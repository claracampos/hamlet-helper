      Slanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here that old men have grey
      beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and
      plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with
      most weak hams. All which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently
      believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down. For you
      yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab you could go
      backward.

      judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine -- an excellent play,
      well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I
      remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
      savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of
      affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by
      very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, I chiefly loved.

      lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be
      well used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time.
      After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report
      while you live.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">POLONIUS.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      God's bodikin, man, better. Use every man after his desert, and who should
      scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity. The less they
      deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">POLONIUS.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Come, sirs.</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p className="stage-direction">
      [Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First.]
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play "The Murder of Gonzago"?
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">FIRST PLAYER.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Ay, my lord.</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      We'll ha't tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some
      dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in't, could you
      not?
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">FIRST PLAYER.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Ay, my lord.</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.
    </p>
    <p className="stage-direction">[Exit First Player.]</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      [To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern] My good friends, I'll leave you till
      night. You are welcome to Elsinore.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">ROSENCRANTZ.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Good my lord.</p>
    <p className="stage-direction">[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Ay, so, God b' wi' ye. Now I am alone.</p>
    <p className="word-split">O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</p>
    <p className="word-split">Is it not monstrous that this player here,</p>
    <p className="word-split">But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Could force his soul so to his own conceit</p>
    <p className="word-split">That from her working all his visage wan'd;</p>
    <p className="word-split">Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,</p>
    <p className="word-split">A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">For Hecuba?</p>
    <p className="word-split">What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,</p>
    <p className="word-split">That he should weep for her? What would he do,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Had he the motive and the cue for passion</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;</p>
    <p className="word-split">Make mad the guilty, and appal the free,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,</p>
    <p className="word-split">The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,</p>
    <p className="word-split">A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak</p>
    <p className="word-split">Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,</p>
    <p className="word-split">And can say nothing. No, not for a king</p>
    <p className="word-split">Upon whose property and most dear life</p>
    <p className="word-split">A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?</p>
    <p className="word-split">Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across?</p>
    <p className="word-split">Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i' th' throat
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Ha! 'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall</p>
    <p className="word-split">To make oppression bitter, or ere this</p>
    <p className="word-split">I should have fatted all the region kites</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      With this slave's offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">Oh vengeance!</p>
    <p className="word-split">Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,</p>
    <p className="word-split">That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words</p>
    <p className="word-split">And fall a-cursing like a very drab,</p>
    <p className="word-split">A scullion! Fie upon't! Foh!</p>
    <p className="word-split">About, my brain! I have heard</p>
    <p className="word-split">That guilty creatures sitting at a play,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Have by the very cunning of the scene,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Been struck so to the soul that presently</p>
    <p className="word-split">They have proclaim'd their malefactions.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">
      With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">Play something like the murder of my father</p>
    <p className="word-split">Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;</p>
    <p className="word-split">I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,</p>
    <p className="word-split">I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</p>
    <p className="word-split">May be the devil, and the devil hath power</p>
    <p className="word-split">T'assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps</p>
    <p className="word-split">Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</p>
    <p className="word-split">As he is very potent with such spirits,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds</p>
    <p className="word-split">More relative than this. The play's the thing</p>
    <p className="word-split">Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.</p>
    <p className="stage-direction">[Exit.]</p>
