    <p className="word-split">
      So much for this, sir. Now let me see the other;
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">You do remember all the circumstance?</p>

    <p className="character-name">HORATIO.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Remember it, my lord!</p>

    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting</p>
    <p className="word-split">That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">
      And prais'd be rashness for it, -- let us know,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us

    <p className="word-split">Rough-hew them how we will.</p>

    <p className="character-name">HORATIO.</p>
    <p className="word-split">That is most certain.</p>

    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Up from my cabin,</p>
    <p className="word-split">My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark</p>
    <p className="word-split">Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Finger'd their packet, and in fine, withdrew</p>
    <p className="word-split">To mine own room again, making so bold,</p>
    <p className="word-split">My fears forgetting manners, to unseal</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">Oh royal knavery! an exact command,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Larded with many several sorts of reasons,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,</p>
    <p className="word-split">With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,</p>
    <p className="word-split">That on the supervise, no leisure bated,</p>
    <p className="word-split">No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,</p>
    <p className="word-split">My head should be struck off.</p>

    <p className="character-name">HORATIO.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Is't possible?</p>

    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Here's the commission, read it at more leisure.
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?</p>

    <p className="character-name">HORATIO.</p>
    <p className="word-split">I beseech you.</p>

    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Being thus benetted round with villanies, -- </p>
    <p className="word-split">Or I could make a prologue to my brains,</p>
    <p className="word-split">They had begun the play, -- I sat me down,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Devis'd a new commission, wrote it fair:</p>
    <p className="word-split">I once did hold it, as our statists do,</p>
    <p className="word-split">A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much</p>
    <p className="word-split">How to forget that learning; but, sir, now</p>
    <p className="word-split">It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know</p>
    <p className="word-split">The effect of what I wrote?</p>

    <p className="character-name">HORATIO.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Ay, good my lord.</p>

    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">An earnest conjuration from the King,</p>
    <p className="word-split">As England was his faithful tributary,</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">As peace should still her wheaten garland wear</p>
    <p className="word-split">And stand a comma 'tween their amities,</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      And many such-like &lsquo;as'es of great charge,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">That on the view and know of these contents,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Without debatement further, more or less,</p>
    <p className="word-split">He should the bearers put to sudden death,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Not shriving-time allow'd.</p>

    <p className="character-name">HORATIO.</p>
    <p className="word-split">How was this seal'd?</p>

    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.</p>
    <p className="word-split">I had my father's signet in my purse,</p>
    <p className="word-split">Which was the model of that Danish seal:</p>
    <p className="word-split">Folded the writ up in the form of the other,</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Subscrib'd it: gave't th'impression; plac'd it safely,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">The changeling never known. Now, the next day</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent

    <p className="word-split">Thou know'st already.</p>

    <p className="character-name">HORATIO.</p>
    <p className="word-split">So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.</p>

    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Why, man, they did make love to this employment.
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">They are not near my conscience; their defeat</p>
    <p className="word-split">Does by their own insinuation grow.</p>
    <p className="word-split">'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes</p>
    <p className="word-split">Between the pass and fell incensed points</p>
    <p className="word-split">Of mighty opposites.</p>

    <p className="word-split">Why, what a king is this!</p>

    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon, --{" "}

      He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother,
    </p>

      And with such cozenage -- is't not perfect conscience

    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">It will be short. The interim is mine;</p>

      And a man's life's no more than to say &lsquo;One'.
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</p>

    <p className="word-split">For by the image of my cause I see</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.

      Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to

      Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come
      to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most
      excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed, to
      speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for you
      shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.

    <p className="word-split">
      Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, to divide
      him inventorially would dizzy th'arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
      neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I
      take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and
      rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror and
      who else would trace him his umbrage, nothing more.

    <p className="character-name">OSRIC.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses, against the which
      he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
      assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are
      very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
      and of very liberal conceit.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>

    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>

      The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by
      our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. Six Barbary
      horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal
      conceited carriages: that's the French bet against the Danish. Why is this
      all imponed, as you call it?
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">OSRIC.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, he
      shall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine. And it
      would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">How if I answer no?</p>

    <p className="word-split">
      Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the
      breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman
      willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if
      not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
