      What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.

      What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.</p>
    <p className="character-name">ROSENCRANTZ.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
    </p>
    <p className="word-split">And bear it to the chapel.</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Do not believe it.</p>
    <p className="character-name">ROSENCRANTZ.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Believe what?</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of
      a sponge -- what replication should be made by the son of a king?
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">ROSENCRANTZ.</p>
    <p className="word-split">Take you me for a sponge, my lord?</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards, his
      authorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end: he
      keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be
      last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing
      you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">ROSENCRANTZ.</p>
    <p className="word-split">I understand you not, my lord.</p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">ROSENCRANTZ.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.
    </p>
    <p className="character-name">HAMLET.</p>
    <p className="word-split">
      The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King is
      a thing --
